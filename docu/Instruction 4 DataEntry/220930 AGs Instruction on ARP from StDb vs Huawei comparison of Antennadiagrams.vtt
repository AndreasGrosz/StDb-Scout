WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.320
Yeah, hello, today I show you how to use GIMP, this software, graphic software or Photoshop

00:20.320 --> 00:36.440
can also be used to find out whether two antenna diagrams are identical or have differences

00:36.440 --> 00:38.560
in it.

00:38.560 --> 00:44.240
With this tool you open one of the files.

00:44.240 --> 01:03.560
In this case it will be the technical data from Huawei.

01:03.560 --> 01:12.200
So this technical data sheet consists of five pages, but we just use the last one in this

01:12.200 --> 01:16.960
case, because here you can see the diagrams.

01:16.960 --> 01:24.160
The other pages contain just tables.

01:24.160 --> 01:33.880
So we mark this just to select one page and import that.

01:33.880 --> 01:37.120
Now it is here.

01:37.120 --> 02:01.320
So next I open a second file and you use open as levels.

02:01.320 --> 02:12.360
And you open the Standout Datenblatt, a data sheet for this antenna, and here we have the

02:12.360 --> 02:14.680
same problem.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.960
Which pages are we interested in?

02:17.960 --> 02:27.720
You should prepare this before you open, that you know what you want to look at.

02:27.720 --> 02:47.520
So I open this again in another viewer, there we are, here's the viewer, and I orient myself

02:47.520 --> 02:51.920
where these diagrams are, which I'm interested in.

02:51.920 --> 03:16.920
What's these pages? Page 20 to 27, 8 pages. So I can close this and select 20 to 27.

03:16.920 --> 03:38.880
So, they will be opened as levels, this is German, in English it will be shown as levels,

03:38.880 --> 04:07.320
you import. After this, the levels or pages will be shown here at the right and the problem

04:07.320 --> 04:22.680
is that these pages are in landscape mode. So you open image, adjust to the

04:22.680 --> 04:25.320
levels.

04:25.320 --> 04:31.920
Now we can see this.

04:31.920 --> 04:38.400
So you see the first image and behind this the second and so on.

04:38.400 --> 04:55.840
So you switch off all the other images and drag the one from the data sheet whereby to

04:55.840 --> 05:00.840
to the top, and then you'll see here are several images.

05:25.840 --> 05:55.560
And we want to compare this, and we compare this one.

05:55.840 --> 06:14.200
For the first step, what we do, we get rid of the white background of this image that

06:14.200 --> 06:27.800
works like this. Level. Now colors. And look out that you mark this page here. And then

06:27.800 --> 06:40.440
colors. Color to alpha. Choose white which is default and say okay. Now the color is

06:40.440 --> 06:50.440
gone. You will see this if you switch off this page. Now you see it has no background anymore.

06:54.280 --> 07:01.720
And this is the image we want to compare it with to the right. This one.

07:01.720 --> 07:23.040
so we cut out which frequency this is about the frequency this is here

07:23.040 --> 07:35.280
frequency 700 to 900 and something that is this image so we look in this image

07:35.280 --> 07:48.840
for the same 690 to 960 that is the one we need so we cut this out make sure

07:48.840 --> 07:59.840
that we are talking about this image. So click here and now draw a rectangle.

07:59.840 --> 08:28.040
and with copy we copy this and now we can paste it as a new level paste there we are

08:28.040 --> 08:39.520
Create a new level, but not level, I always use the wrong word, it's layers, not level.

08:39.520 --> 08:56.400
To a new layer, switch off this image, switch on this, and drag this layer over this one.

08:56.400 --> 09:08.800
So, first to the side.

09:08.800 --> 09:15.680
Then we see that the orientation of this is towards the top and here it is towards the

09:15.680 --> 09:16.680
right.

09:16.680 --> 09:19.100
But it should be the same.

09:19.100 --> 09:26.100
So we have to turn this one to the right to make it similar.

09:26.100 --> 09:32.100
Transformation, turn 90%.

09:32.100 --> 09:39.100
Now it has the right, the correct orientation.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.100
But it has a different size.

09:41.100 --> 09:46.100
We have to adjust the size too.

09:46.100 --> 09:49.100
And for this we have to measure the size.

09:57.100 --> 10:00.100
Use the measure tool.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.100
Click here on one end.

10:07.100 --> 10:08.100
Draw down.

10:08.100 --> 10:14.100
And at the bottom you can read the size 163.

10:16.100 --> 10:35.580
We put 163 into the calculator, by, and then you measure this thing, that is 295, it's

10:35.580 --> 10:44.140
down here, by 295.

10:44.140 --> 11:03.020
55 percent or if you take the reverse value, 181 percent. So you go here, say

11:03.020 --> 11:16.780
scale level change this to percent 181 percent scale it now it has the same

11:16.780 --> 11:22.140
size now you can draw it over

11:22.140 --> 11:41.260
And look that the middle point is exactly on the other midpoint, like this.

11:41.260 --> 11:52.100
And now we find the fault as expected, because this, which I switch on and off, is the original

11:52.100 --> 12:13.100
original data, and this is the given data.

12:22.100 --> 12:42.300
And the stunt or dark blood.

12:42.300 --> 12:50.420
So we add another layer, now this goes by automatic, the new layer.

12:50.420 --> 13:06.740
Now we add a text field, find space where we could write some text, choose color, let's

13:06.740 --> 13:23.740
Let's say blue, and write blue, the other one, who am I?

13:53.740 --> 14:07.380
Okay, that's this part.

14:07.380 --> 14:21.060
Now we take care about the, this is the horizontal part, horizontal, you see it here, now we

14:21.060 --> 14:31.300
take care about the vertical part. The vertical diagram is this, or from Huawei it's in red.

14:31.300 --> 14:54.300
So we go back to the worldwide, this one, make a copy of it, that is here, yeah, copy,

14:54.300 --> 15:12.940
Switch this off, take the copy, draw this to the, here towards this, now we have to

15:12.940 --> 15:33.380
turn it back. This one. Level. Transformation. Back. And now we can put it on top. If you

15:33.380 --> 15:37.380
We want to be very precise, to size it up.

15:45.380 --> 15:47.380
There we are.

15:55.380 --> 15:58.380
So, and again, we need a text field.

15:58.380 --> 16:15.020
For this, we could just copy this one, same as here, copy and move it down here and change

16:15.020 --> 16:23.060
the text.

16:23.060 --> 16:45.060
Mark the text icon, and this is red, red diagram, black, stand on top, stand on four, vertical.

16:45.060 --> 16:56.260
Let's change it to vertical and blue, keep that blue, and here we change, add the text

16:56.260 --> 17:24.020
Torisonto, Torisonto, also in German, no, yeah, now, switch this on again, if you want

17:24.020 --> 17:44.020
to do it very nice then we should delete most of the red things so we go to this

17:44.020 --> 18:08.420
level take the rubber and delete the red line because this is confusing here in this diagram.

18:08.420 --> 18:15.460
If you delete some of these dots, it doesn't matter, and if you delete it too much, like

18:15.460 --> 18:32.460
here in this case, you can undo it with CTRL Z, or you can size it up to make it easier.

19:02.460 --> 19:09.460
th

19:32.460 --> 19:57.460
And here the same but the blue line must go, so mark this level and delete the blue line.

19:57.460 --> 20:00.460
If you...

20:57.460 --> 21:17.460
Yeah, that's good.

21:17.460 --> 21:24.740
Okay.

21:24.740 --> 21:48.360
That's all I wanted.

21:48.360 --> 21:56.360
So now, the same with other pages.

21:56.360 --> 22:24.360
Here we have the page for frequency, same frequency, we don't need the same again, we

22:24.360 --> 22:29.360
I can add a white page at the end.

22:29.360 --> 22:55.560
so this page first must be turned back

22:55.560 --> 23:18.320
We have to find this, this is this page, and turn it against clockwise, counter-clockwise,

23:18.320 --> 23:23.600
drag it towards this.

23:33.920 --> 23:38.560
Yeah, and again

23:40.080 --> 23:43.120
drag it here.

23:43.120 --> 24:07.120
Take out the other lever, this one, and that is the Y.

24:07.120 --> 24:28.400
So, we drag it to the center, there we are.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.400
already fits.

24:58.400 --> 25:27.600
So, the third page is also good.

25:27.600 --> 25:52.600
Next page is here, we have to drag this one until it fits.

25:57.600 --> 26:16.600
That is 1800.

26:16.600 --> 26:45.600
So, if we write the frequency here, to name this, that is AD for antenna diagram, 690

26:45.600 --> 26:50.080
9p to 960

27:02.720 --> 27:04.720
It's the same

27:45.600 --> 28:04.440
No, I made a mistake.

28:04.440 --> 28:10.400
The value for the frequency is this one, the smaller line above.

28:10.400 --> 28:18.080
so that is 700, 800, 900

28:26.720 --> 28:27.920
and here the same

28:36.000 --> 28:37.360
and here the same

28:40.400 --> 29:08.400
And now we have 1800 in 10 diagram, 1821, 2636.

29:38.400 --> 30:06.400
Next level, we have to move again.

30:06.400 --> 30:13.400
and the same frequency.

30:36.400 --> 30:45.400
I took the wrong key. It's not AG, it's AD.

30:49.400 --> 30:50.400
AD.

30:55.400 --> 30:56.400
AD.

31:06.400 --> 31:13.400
th

31:36.400 --> 32:01.400
So, and the last one... no, that is the last one.

32:01.400 --> 32:19.840
Good.

32:19.840 --> 32:38.840
So now we need to compare it with the right frequency, because here we compare 600 to

32:38.840 --> 32:47.760
900 megahertz with 3600.

32:47.760 --> 33:07.560
So we have to switch off this, like this, and add the correct level from the diagram

33:07.560 --> 33:35.160
that was here, that was this one, this one, so we go to this level,

33:37.560 --> 34:07.040
Make a rectangle around that, copy, insert, add to new layer, switch this off and move

34:07.040 --> 34:34.800
this layer towards this diagram and we copy this for horizontal and for vertical.

34:37.040 --> 34:54.040
Vertical is already in the, we go back again because first we have to resize it, it was

34:54.040 --> 35:14.440
181% scale, the layer, 181% scale, and now we copy it, and can drag the copy here.

35:24.040 --> 35:32.040
It does not fit really. It's smaller, huh?

35:37.040 --> 35:40.040
So we have to do the resize again.

35:54.040 --> 36:23.960
Yeah, we have to do the measurement again.

36:23.960 --> 36:45.160
to get the right size. So, from one end to the other. Drag and drop this. It's 284.

37:15.160 --> 37:31.280
one hundred and five percent

37:45.160 --> 38:09.660
this one must be resized. Big bigger. A bit bigger. Scale 105%. Scale. And now it fits.

38:09.660 --> 38:19.660
So, we make a copy and drag this copy to the Vertigo Diabra.

38:29.660 --> 38:34.660
And we write something here.

38:34.660 --> 38:54.660
Where have I got to go for 269T and the other one?

39:04.660 --> 39:23.660
And of course, now I write vertical for 900.

39:34.660 --> 40:03.760
Six and a half, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

40:33.760 --> 41:01.160
So when all is in place, in this case we can

41:01.160 --> 41:24.660
draw the size of the page, which fits all, mark all,

41:24.660 --> 41:29.060
Drag this to this page.

41:29.060 --> 41:53.220
And now...

41:53.220 --> 42:21.140
image by selection. So now we have a nice page here, and we can

42:21.140 --> 42:51.060
shoes, what do we like, what is this, who am I?

42:51.140 --> 42:57.140
Vertical 690

43:06.140 --> 43:09.140
Boai horizontal

43:10.140 --> 43:12.140
Boai vertical

43:15.140 --> 43:17.140
Should be the same, no?

43:21.140 --> 43:25.140
Let's take a look.

43:36.140 --> 43:39.140
Ah, here's the size problem.

43:44.140 --> 43:48.140
The 5% is somehow wrong.

43:51.140 --> 44:20.140
OK, this one is too small, so we just choose this and size it up, so that's it.

44:20.140 --> 44:24.140
Size it up, scale, 105 percent.

44:28.140 --> 44:30.140
Now it fits.

44:32.140 --> 44:36.140
So, we have the 960.

44:41.140 --> 44:45.140
And this is also for about the 900.

46:20.140 --> 46:48.300
okay that's it now we save this under the name

46:50.140 --> 47:04.820
Now, take this name and that's what I need to be done.

47:04.820 --> 47:05.620
Thank you.
