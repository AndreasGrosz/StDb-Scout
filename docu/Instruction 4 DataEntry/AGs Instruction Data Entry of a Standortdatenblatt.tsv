0	22380	Hello, I show you how to do the data entry from the data sheet, the given Standort Datenblatt.
22380	33820	You look for this page first for the page called Zusatzplatt 2.
33820	37340	It's also A2.
37340	41780	This is where you start.
41780	50340	And you open a template for the calculation.
50340	58340	And there you find the term Zusatzblatt 2, again here.
58340	65700	So now you enter the data, which is here in red.
65700	79660	you look up above, you start with the date of the sheet, which you cannot find here on
79660	93740	this page. So you have to start on the first page. I go back to the first page. This is
93740	107860	the first page here. And at the bottom you find the date. And you put it here.
107860	126260	And the revision number is 1.22 and the address of the antenna, which you find usually on
126260	131260	page three at the top, yes, the address.
131260	160780	And yeah, that's not right, you don't have to change this, it's the newest revision of
160780	185980	this template. So next data in red is Höhenquote. This was on page A2. Here we are. Höhenquote.
190780	216380	1099, 1099 dot, nothing more here.
216380	228140	Now the frequency. Frequency is here. At least you check that you enter the right values.
228140	251040	it's has to be changed 1800 so these depend on that so but you can overwrite
251040	264600	this so now there are only six not more you sometimes number seven is on the
264600	272720	next page or down next table not in this case in this case you only have six
272720	283400	columns and in the template you have much more. I had 18 columns so you just
283400	290400	delete the unneeded columns.
302400	306400	Delete the columns.
306400	321720	So that was the frequency. Now the company who creates it. Sometimes you have a different
321720	333040	name in different columns. Not in this case. It's all the same. Swisscom. Next line is
333040	351240	the antenna type, so you just put the antenna type into your clipboard and enter it here.
351240	357520	By automatic, this is copied to the other columns, but you have to check because sometimes
357520	361040	Sometimes it is different.
361040	368000	The difference at the end of the name is of no importance.
368000	379460	Best is even to delete it, because this end is the same.
379460	383680	It indicates just the frequency.
383680	401320	You see it here 7, 8, 900, 700 to 900 is here and here it is 18, 21, 26, 36 is this frequency.
401320	425440	So just delete the rest, and this is not an O, it is a zero, and that is not an L, it
425440	441280	is the one, so that would be the correct type. Next, adaptiver Betrieb is no no no no, always,
441280	454880	and subarrays it's always zero or none. Now we have Höhe der Antenne that is
454880	479080	different. So you take this for the first. And this for the second. And this again.
479080	500440	And now the power, Sendeleistung, just add this.
500440	529600	And the values for the direction azimuth is 60.
529600	540800	And this repeats, usually.
540800	570040	So horizontal 0, 9, 6, 0, 9, 6, and the other one is minus 2.
570040	596200	minus 2, minus 2, minus, minus 12, minus 7, minus 12, minus 12, and that is a calculated
596200	607480	line we keep it as it is calculated and that's all on this sheet so you scroll
607480	623800	down to the next one and here you scroll down to number of Omen number one that
623800	638040	is this the number in situation plan is 1 so perhaps 0 1 and now we have to save
638040	648200	the file the table to the name we just found
648200	652760	Omen 01
665600	677400	Adresse und Beschreibung. Beschreibung der Adresse. Mast, Fuß. That's what you put here.
678200	698600	And here Nutzung, this field is here. Nutzung after the double dot. Durch Zugang.
708200	736400	This is the next value we need, that's Höhe über Boden, Höhe über Boden, 1.5, 1.5.
736400	752120	and here we have deleted one entry field that is the next one here over here in
752120	766640	0, also 150.
766640	777480	This was red before, but we deleted it when we deleted the columns, but it doesn't care
777480	785280	whether it's red or not it's just for your orientation while enter the data so
785280	793320	now the next values from the table and the top of this table repeats the
793320	801960	format table so you don't have to put this in again but we continue with
801960	813440	horizontal distance or your central distance it's zero zero keep this
815480	825200	whoo on the sheets vision antenna and oka who notice sheet here you put these
825200	853560	is 8.20, 11, 8.20, 8.20, 11, and 8.20.
853560	858560	So, in fact, this is our entry fields.
862520	866240	Should not be gray and should be red.
867160	870240	That is a mistake in the template.
870240	872820	I have to correct this for the next revision.
874160	877120	But this is the line which is calculated
877120	879920	and it is correctly calculated.
879920	881560	I have the same values.
881560	884560	And now the next.
892560	894560	Azimuth.
895560	897560	Azimuth.
897560	920400	We have to write in this, that is 180.
920400	925400	All fields, copy this across the line.
928920	929960	Elevation.
932760	937400	This is taken from above, so don't change anything there.
938460	939380	It's gray.
944800	948660	Critical horizontal senderichtung.
948660	975660	Critical horizontal senderichtung, 60, that's correct, vertical, star 2, plus 7, minus 7,
975660	990020	Minus 12, 2, and minus 17.
990020	1001620	The next two you just check, usually it is correct, yes, and here too, it's the same,
1001620	1010140	dis-calculated values. So next red fields to be entered are these Richtungsabschwächung,
1010140	1032340	25.9, 11.3, 5.3, 25, 12.4, 2, 4.
1040140	1067460	Oops.
1067460	1072460	Next two are calculated.
1072460	1083420	Next red one is not given here in this case, but we will see it in the next example.
1083420	1093880	So keep this and look for the final value and they calculated 13.25 and we calculated
1093880	1118400	13.15. I have an idea how this comes. There is somewhere a rounding here.
1118400	1130400	I don't care about the difference.
1130400	1137280	It's about 1% difference, so if it is 1% difference, then don't care about this.
1137280	1139680	That's correct.
1139680	1144320	We did it correctly.
1144320	1157160	So you save this again, save, and scroll down to the next page.
1157160	1161140	Next page is Omen number 2.
1161140	1178380	So for this, we save this under a new name, 02.
1178380	1181060	And the top is the same.
1181060	1188300	We start here with 02.
1188300	1213500	And now the address of this point, enter the address, and the purpose of it, wunnen.
1213500	1241500	And the other value, value, value, value is nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine,
1241500	1244860	The value is 9.2.
1253140	1256740	Go down, this is repeated.
1256740	1261620	And now we are, we look for horizontal
1261620	1264100	upstand, horizontal upstand.
1265900	1270740	45.3 through the whole row.
1271500	1290620	okay 5.3 next to is calculated no this is not calculated has to be entered point
1290620	1311080	point five, three three, point five, point five, three three, point five, yes and this
1311080	1322920	This should be calculated identical, just check.
1322920	1350040	And the next row, as you would, 244, 244 across the row.
1350040	1372480	it's the same critical horizontal critical horizontal critical horizontal 60 it's the same
1372480	1400940	and minus four minus yeah minus two plus four minus one minus two minus one minus one
1402480	1428200	Here is the difference, but it's not red, so you don't enter it, but here.
1428200	1455200	24.8, 4.9, 7.8, 26.5, 4.4, 10.2
1458200	1479280	Next line, 0.1, 0.4, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.
1479280	1489880	is calculated and here you find Bauweise, Glass, Glass, zero. It's the only two you
1489880	1502400	have to enter, the rest is identical. And to check whether you are right, you look
1502400	1516200	Look at these values, this row, and that should be identical to this row.
1516200	1531760	There is a small difference, but it's about 1%, so don't care, similar here, but perhaps
1531760	1540720	you could find. The reason if you go up in the values which are different,
1540720	1553320	perhaps you could mark this as different and go up and find what might be the
1553320	1558320	Because of the difference, it's somewhere in these data.
1560320	1561320	It's this.
1562320	1565320	This value. Let's check.
1583320	1601720	did not help much but okay yeah and here is also as a result big difference but
1601720	1609920	it's just one percent so don't care about this otherwise you you look which
1609920	1621560	column is much different this compare this with this where the difference is
1621560	1631360	and then you find the values which are wrong which are these two columns and
1631360	1639280	then you go back and look which what values might have been entered wrongly
1639280	1658320	by you. Yeah, that's it. Now you'll save this again under the name 02 and now you continue
1658320	1675240	up to the next one three and save under the new name three and continue as
1675240	1676240	as before.
1686240	1688760	Put in three here, zero, three.
1694360	1699480	Brunnistraße, that is third floor.
1699480	1715600	It's also wohnen here and the horizontal distance is different.
1715600	1745320	Höhe über Boden, 10.33, 11.90, that's this, and so on, as shown before.
1745320	1755320	Thank you for your patience, enjoy and you can help me a lot with this work.
