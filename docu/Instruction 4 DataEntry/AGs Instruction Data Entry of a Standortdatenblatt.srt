00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,380
Hello, I show you how to do the data entry from the data sheet, the given Standort Datenblatt.

2
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:33,820
You look for this page first for the page called Zusatzplatt 2.

3
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,340
It's also A2.

4
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,780
This is where you start.

5
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:50,340
And you open a template for the calculation.

6
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:58,340
And there you find the term Zusatzblatt 2, again here.

7
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:05,700
So now you enter the data, which is here in red.

8
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:19,660
you look up above, you start with the date of the sheet, which you cannot find here on

9
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:33,740
this page. So you have to start on the first page. I go back to the first page. This is

10
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:47,860
the first page here. And at the bottom you find the date. And you put it here.

11
00:01:47,860 --> 00:02:06,260
And the revision number is 1.22 and the address of the antenna, which you find usually on

12
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:11,260
page three at the top, yes, the address.

13
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:40,780
And yeah, that's not right, you don't have to change this, it's the newest revision of

14
00:02:40,780 --> 00:03:05,980
this template. So next data in red is Höhenquote. This was on page A2. Here we are. Höhenquote.

15
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:36,380
1099, 1099 dot, nothing more here.

16
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:48,140
Now the frequency. Frequency is here. At least you check that you enter the right values.

17
00:03:48,140 --> 00:04:11,040
it's has to be changed 1800 so these depend on that so but you can overwrite

18
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:24,600
this so now there are only six not more you sometimes number seven is on the

19
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:32,720
next page or down next table not in this case in this case you only have six

20
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:43,400
columns and in the template you have much more. I had 18 columns so you just

21
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:50,400
delete the unneeded columns.

22
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Delete the columns.

23
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:21,720
So that was the frequency. Now the company who creates it. Sometimes you have a different

24
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:33,040
name in different columns. Not in this case. It's all the same. Swisscom. Next line is

25
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:51,240
the antenna type, so you just put the antenna type into your clipboard and enter it here.

26
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,520
By automatic, this is copied to the other columns, but you have to check because sometimes

27
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,040
Sometimes it is different.

28
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:08,000
The difference at the end of the name is of no importance.

29
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:19,460
Best is even to delete it, because this end is the same.

30
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,680
It indicates just the frequency.

31
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:41,320
You see it here 7, 8, 900, 700 to 900 is here and here it is 18, 21, 26, 36 is this frequency.

32
00:06:41,320 --> 00:07:05,440
So just delete the rest, and this is not an O, it is a zero, and that is not an L, it

33
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:21,280
is the one, so that would be the correct type. Next, adaptiver Betrieb is no no no no, always,

34
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:34,880
and subarrays it's always zero or none. Now we have Höhe der Antenne that is

35
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:59,080
different. So you take this for the first. And this for the second. And this again.

36
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:20,440
And now the power, Sendeleistung, just add this.

37
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:49,600
And the values for the direction azimuth is 60.

38
00:08:49,600 --> 00:09:00,800
And this repeats, usually.

39
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:30,040
So horizontal 0, 9, 6, 0, 9, 6, and the other one is minus 2.

40
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:56,200
minus 2, minus 2, minus, minus 12, minus 7, minus 12, minus 12, and that is a calculated

41
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:07,480
line we keep it as it is calculated and that's all on this sheet so you scroll

42
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:23,800
down to the next one and here you scroll down to number of Omen number one that

43
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:38,040
is this the number in situation plan is 1 so perhaps 0 1 and now we have to save

44
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:48,200
the file the table to the name we just found

45
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,760
Omen 01

46
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:17,400
Adresse und Beschreibung. Beschreibung der Adresse. Mast, Fuß. That's what you put here.

47
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:38,600
And here Nutzung, this field is here. Nutzung after the double dot. Durch Zugang.

48
00:11:48,200 --> 00:12:16,400
This is the next value we need, that's Höhe über Boden, Höhe über Boden, 1.5, 1.5.

49
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:32,120
and here we have deleted one entry field that is the next one here over here in

50
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:46,640
0, also 150.

51
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:57,480
This was red before, but we deleted it when we deleted the columns, but it doesn't care

52
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:05,280
whether it's red or not it's just for your orientation while enter the data so

53
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:13,320
now the next values from the table and the top of this table repeats the

54
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:21,960
format table so you don't have to put this in again but we continue with

55
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:33,440
horizontal distance or your central distance it's zero zero keep this

56
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:45,200
whoo on the sheets vision antenna and oka who notice sheet here you put these

57
00:13:45,200 --> 00:14:13,560
is 8.20, 11, 8.20, 8.20, 11, and 8.20.

58
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,560
So, in fact, this is our entry fields.

59
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,240
Should not be gray and should be red.

60
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,240
That is a mistake in the template.

61
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,820
I have to correct this for the next revision.

62
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,120
But this is the line which is calculated

63
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,920
and it is correctly calculated.

64
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,560
I have the same values.

65
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,560
And now the next.

66
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
Azimuth.

67
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,560
Azimuth.

68
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:20,400
We have to write in this, that is 180.

69
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,400
All fields, copy this across the line.

70
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,960
Elevation.

71
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,400
This is taken from above, so don't change anything there.

72
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,380
It's gray.

73
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,660
Critical horizontal senderichtung.

74
00:15:48,660 --> 00:16:15,660
Critical horizontal senderichtung, 60, that's correct, vertical, star 2, plus 7, minus 7,

75
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:30,020
Minus 12, 2, and minus 17.

76
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:41,620
The next two you just check, usually it is correct, yes, and here too, it's the same,

77
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:50,140
dis-calculated values. So next red fields to be entered are these Richtungsabschwächung,

78
00:16:50,140 --> 00:17:12,340
25.9, 11.3, 5.3, 25, 12.4, 2, 4.

79
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:47,460
Oops.

80
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,460
Next two are calculated.

81
00:17:52,460 --> 00:18:03,420
Next red one is not given here in this case, but we will see it in the next example.

82
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:13,880
So keep this and look for the final value and they calculated 13.25 and we calculated

83
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:38,400
13.15. I have an idea how this comes. There is somewhere a rounding here.

84
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:50,400
I don't care about the difference.

85
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:57,280
It's about 1% difference, so if it is 1% difference, then don't care about this.

86
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,680
That's correct.

87
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,320
We did it correctly.

88
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:17,160
So you save this again, save, and scroll down to the next page.

89
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,140
Next page is Omen number 2.

90
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:38,380
So for this, we save this under a new name, 02.

91
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,060
And the top is the same.

92
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:48,300
We start here with 02.

93
00:19:48,300 --> 00:20:13,500
And now the address of this point, enter the address, and the purpose of it, wunnen.

94
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:41,500
And the other value, value, value, value is nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine,

95
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,860
The value is 9.2.

96
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,740
Go down, this is repeated.

97
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,620
And now we are, we look for horizontal

98
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,100
upstand, horizontal upstand.

99
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,740
45.3 through the whole row.

100
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:30,620
okay 5.3 next to is calculated no this is not calculated has to be entered point

101
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:51,080
point five, three three, point five, point five, three three, point five, yes and this

102
00:21:51,080 --> 00:22:02,920
This should be calculated identical, just check.

103
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:30,040
And the next row, as you would, 244, 244 across the row.

104
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:52,480
it's the same critical horizontal critical horizontal critical horizontal 60 it's the same

105
00:22:52,480 --> 00:23:20,940
and minus four minus yeah minus two plus four minus one minus two minus one minus one

106
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:48,200
Here is the difference, but it's not red, so you don't enter it, but here.

107
00:23:48,200 --> 00:24:15,200
24.8, 4.9, 7.8, 26.5, 4.4, 10.2

108
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:39,280
Next line, 0.1, 0.4, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.

109
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:49,880
is calculated and here you find Bauweise, Glass, Glass, zero. It's the only two you

110
00:24:49,880 --> 00:25:02,400
have to enter, the rest is identical. And to check whether you are right, you look

111
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:16,200
Look at these values, this row, and that should be identical to this row.

112
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:31,760
There is a small difference, but it's about 1%, so don't care, similar here, but perhaps

113
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:40,720
you could find. The reason if you go up in the values which are different,

114
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:53,320
perhaps you could mark this as different and go up and find what might be the

115
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,320
Because of the difference, it's somewhere in these data.

116
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
It's this.

117
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,320
This value. Let's check.

118
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:41,720
did not help much but okay yeah and here is also as a result big difference but

119
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:49,920
it's just one percent so don't care about this otherwise you you look which

120
00:26:49,920 --> 00:27:01,560
column is much different this compare this with this where the difference is

121
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:11,360
and then you find the values which are wrong which are these two columns and

122
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:19,280
then you go back and look which what values might have been entered wrongly

123
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:38,320
by you. Yeah, that's it. Now you'll save this again under the name 02 and now you continue

124
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:55,240
up to the next one three and save under the new name three and continue as

125
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
as before.

126
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,760
Put in three here, zero, three.

127
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,480
Brunnistraße, that is third floor.

128
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:35,600
It's also wohnen here and the horizontal distance is different.

129
00:28:35,600 --> 00:29:05,320
Höhe über Boden, 10.33, 11.90, that's this, and so on, as shown before.

130
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:15,320
Thank you for your patience, enjoy and you can help me a lot with this work.
