0	20320	Yeah, hello, today I show you how to use GIMP, this software, graphic software or Photoshop
20320	36440	can also be used to find out whether two antenna diagrams are identical or have differences
36440	38560	in it.
38560	44240	With this tool you open one of the files.
44240	63560	In this case it will be the technical data from Huawei.
63560	72200	So this technical data sheet consists of five pages, but we just use the last one in this
72200	76960	case, because here you can see the diagrams.
76960	84160	The other pages contain just tables.
84160	93880	So we mark this just to select one page and import that.
93880	97120	Now it is here.
97120	121320	So next I open a second file and you use open as levels.
121320	132360	And you open the Standout Datenblatt, a data sheet for this antenna, and here we have the
132360	134680	same problem.
134680	137960	Which pages are we interested in?
137960	147720	You should prepare this before you open, that you know what you want to look at.
147720	167520	So I open this again in another viewer, there we are, here's the viewer, and I orient myself
167520	171920	where these diagrams are, which I'm interested in.
171920	196920	What's these pages? Page 20 to 27, 8 pages. So I can close this and select 20 to 27.
196920	218880	So, they will be opened as levels, this is German, in English it will be shown as levels,
218880	247320	you import. After this, the levels or pages will be shown here at the right and the problem
247320	262680	is that these pages are in landscape mode. So you open image, adjust to the
262680	265320	levels.
265320	271920	Now we can see this.
271920	278400	So you see the first image and behind this the second and so on.
278400	295840	So you switch off all the other images and drag the one from the data sheet whereby to
295840	300840	to the top, and then you'll see here are several images.
325840	355560	And we want to compare this, and we compare this one.
355840	374200	For the first step, what we do, we get rid of the white background of this image that
374200	387800	works like this. Level. Now colors. And look out that you mark this page here. And then
387800	400440	colors. Color to alpha. Choose white which is default and say okay. Now the color is
400440	410440	gone. You will see this if you switch off this page. Now you see it has no background anymore.
414280	421720	And this is the image we want to compare it with to the right. This one.
421720	443040	so we cut out which frequency this is about the frequency this is here
443040	455280	frequency 700 to 900 and something that is this image so we look in this image
455280	468840	for the same 690 to 960 that is the one we need so we cut this out make sure
468840	479840	that we are talking about this image. So click here and now draw a rectangle.
479840	508040	and with copy we copy this and now we can paste it as a new level paste there we are
508040	519520	Create a new level, but not level, I always use the wrong word, it's layers, not level.
519520	536400	To a new layer, switch off this image, switch on this, and drag this layer over this one.
536400	548800	So, first to the side.
548800	555680	Then we see that the orientation of this is towards the top and here it is towards the
555680	556680	right.
556680	559100	But it should be the same.
559100	566100	So we have to turn this one to the right to make it similar.
566100	572100	Transformation, turn 90%.
572100	579100	Now it has the right, the correct orientation.
579100	581100	But it has a different size.
581100	586100	We have to adjust the size too.
586100	589100	And for this we have to measure the size.
597100	600100	Use the measure tool.
600100	603100	Click here on one end.
607100	608100	Draw down.
608100	614100	And at the bottom you can read the size 163.
616100	635580	We put 163 into the calculator, by, and then you measure this thing, that is 295, it's
635580	644140	down here, by 295.
644140	663020	55 percent or if you take the reverse value, 181 percent. So you go here, say
663020	676780	scale level change this to percent 181 percent scale it now it has the same
676780	682140	size now you can draw it over
682140	701260	And look that the middle point is exactly on the other midpoint, like this.
701260	712100	And now we find the fault as expected, because this, which I switch on and off, is the original
712100	733100	original data, and this is the given data.
742100	762300	And the stunt or dark blood.
762300	770420	So we add another layer, now this goes by automatic, the new layer.
770420	786740	Now we add a text field, find space where we could write some text, choose color, let's
786740	803740	Let's say blue, and write blue, the other one, who am I?
833740	847380	Okay, that's this part.
847380	861060	Now we take care about the, this is the horizontal part, horizontal, you see it here, now we
861060	871300	take care about the vertical part. The vertical diagram is this, or from Huawei it's in red.
871300	894300	So we go back to the worldwide, this one, make a copy of it, that is here, yeah, copy,
894300	912940	Switch this off, take the copy, draw this to the, here towards this, now we have to
912940	933380	turn it back. This one. Level. Transformation. Back. And now we can put it on top. If you
933380	937380	We want to be very precise, to size it up.
945380	947380	There we are.
955380	958380	So, and again, we need a text field.
958380	975020	For this, we could just copy this one, same as here, copy and move it down here and change
975020	983060	the text.
983060	1005060	Mark the text icon, and this is red, red diagram, black, stand on top, stand on four, vertical.
1005060	1016260	Let's change it to vertical and blue, keep that blue, and here we change, add the text
1016260	1044020	Torisonto, Torisonto, also in German, no, yeah, now, switch this on again, if you want
1044020	1064020	to do it very nice then we should delete most of the red things so we go to this
1064020	1088420	level take the rubber and delete the red line because this is confusing here in this diagram.
1088420	1095460	If you delete some of these dots, it doesn't matter, and if you delete it too much, like
1095460	1112460	here in this case, you can undo it with CTRL Z, or you can size it up to make it easier.
1142460	1149460	th
1172460	1197460	And here the same but the blue line must go, so mark this level and delete the blue line.
1197460	1200460	If you...
1257460	1277460	Yeah, that's good.
1277460	1284740	Okay.
1284740	1308360	That's all I wanted.
1308360	1316360	So now, the same with other pages.
1316360	1344360	Here we have the page for frequency, same frequency, we don't need the same again, we
1344360	1349360	I can add a white page at the end.
1349360	1375560	so this page first must be turned back
1375560	1398320	We have to find this, this is this page, and turn it against clockwise, counter-clockwise,
1398320	1403600	drag it towards this.
1413920	1418560	Yeah, and again
1420080	1423120	drag it here.
1423120	1447120	Take out the other lever, this one, and that is the Y.
1447120	1468400	So, we drag it to the center, there we are.
1468400	1469400	already fits.
1498400	1527600	So, the third page is also good.
1527600	1552600	Next page is here, we have to drag this one until it fits.
1557600	1576600	That is 1800.
1576600	1605600	So, if we write the frequency here, to name this, that is AD for antenna diagram, 690
1605600	1610080	9p to 960
1622720	1624720	It's the same
1665600	1684440	No, I made a mistake.
1684440	1690400	The value for the frequency is this one, the smaller line above.
1690400	1698080	so that is 700, 800, 900
1706720	1707920	and here the same
1716000	1717360	and here the same
1720400	1748400	And now we have 1800 in 10 diagram, 1821, 2636.
1778400	1806400	Next level, we have to move again.
1806400	1813400	and the same frequency.
1836400	1845400	I took the wrong key. It's not AG, it's AD.
1849400	1850400	AD.
1855400	1856400	AD.
1866400	1873400	th
1896400	1921400	So, and the last one... no, that is the last one.
1921400	1939840	Good.
1939840	1958840	So now we need to compare it with the right frequency, because here we compare 600 to
1958840	1967760	900 megahertz with 3600.
1967760	1987560	So we have to switch off this, like this, and add the correct level from the diagram
1987560	2015160	that was here, that was this one, this one, so we go to this level,
2017560	2047040	Make a rectangle around that, copy, insert, add to new layer, switch this off and move
2047040	2074800	this layer towards this diagram and we copy this for horizontal and for vertical.
2077040	2094040	Vertical is already in the, we go back again because first we have to resize it, it was
2094040	2114440	181% scale, the layer, 181% scale, and now we copy it, and can drag the copy here.
2124040	2132040	It does not fit really. It's smaller, huh?
2137040	2140040	So we have to do the resize again.
2154040	2183960	Yeah, we have to do the measurement again.
2183960	2205160	to get the right size. So, from one end to the other. Drag and drop this. It's 284.
2235160	2251280	one hundred and five percent
2265160	2289660	this one must be resized. Big bigger. A bit bigger. Scale 105%. Scale. And now it fits.
2289660	2299660	So, we make a copy and drag this copy to the Vertigo Diabra.
2309660	2314660	And we write something here.
2314660	2334660	Where have I got to go for 269T and the other one?
2344660	2363660	And of course, now I write vertical for 900.
2374660	2403760	Six and a half, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,
2433760	2461160	So when all is in place, in this case we can
2461160	2484660	draw the size of the page, which fits all, mark all,
2484660	2489060	Drag this to this page.
2489060	2513220	And now...
2513220	2541140	image by selection. So now we have a nice page here, and we can
2541140	2571060	shoes, what do we like, what is this, who am I?
2571140	2577140	Vertical 690
2586140	2589140	Boai horizontal
2590140	2592140	Boai vertical
2595140	2597140	Should be the same, no?
2601140	2605140	Let's take a look.
2616140	2619140	Ah, here's the size problem.
2624140	2628140	The 5% is somehow wrong.
2631140	2660140	OK, this one is too small, so we just choose this and size it up, so that's it.
2660140	2664140	Size it up, scale, 105 percent.
2668140	2670140	Now it fits.
2672140	2676140	So, we have the 960.
2681140	2685140	And this is also for about the 900.
2780140	2808300	okay that's it now we save this under the name
2810140	2824820	Now, take this name and that's what I need to be done.
2824820	2825620	Thank you.
