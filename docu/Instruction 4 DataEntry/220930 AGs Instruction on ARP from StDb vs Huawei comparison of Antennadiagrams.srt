1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,320
Yeah, hello, today I show you how to use GIMP, this software, graphic software or Photoshop

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:36,440
can also be used to find out whether two antenna diagrams are identical or have differences

3
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,560
in it.

4
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,240
With this tool you open one of the files.

5
00:00:44,240 --> 00:01:03,560
In this case it will be the technical data from Huawei.

6
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:12,200
So this technical data sheet consists of five pages, but we just use the last one in this

7
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,960
case, because here you can see the diagrams.

8
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,160
The other pages contain just tables.

9
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:33,880
So we mark this just to select one page and import that.

10
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,120
Now it is here.

11
00:01:37,120 --> 00:02:01,320
So next I open a second file and you use open as levels.

12
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:12,360
And you open the Standout Datenblatt, a data sheet for this antenna, and here we have the

13
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,680
same problem.

14
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,960
Which pages are we interested in?

15
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:27,720
You should prepare this before you open, that you know what you want to look at.

16
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:47,520
So I open this again in another viewer, there we are, here's the viewer, and I orient myself

17
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,920
where these diagrams are, which I'm interested in.

18
00:02:51,920 --> 00:03:16,920
What's these pages? Page 20 to 27, 8 pages. So I can close this and select 20 to 27.

19
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:38,880
So, they will be opened as levels, this is German, in English it will be shown as levels,

20
00:03:38,880 --> 00:04:07,320
you import. After this, the levels or pages will be shown here at the right and the problem

21
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:22,680
is that these pages are in landscape mode. So you open image, adjust to the

22
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,320
levels.

23
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,920
Now we can see this.

24
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,400
So you see the first image and behind this the second and so on.

25
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:55,840
So you switch off all the other images and drag the one from the data sheet whereby to

26
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,840
to the top, and then you'll see here are several images.

27
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:55,560
And we want to compare this, and we compare this one.

28
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:14,200
For the first step, what we do, we get rid of the white background of this image that

29
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:27,800
works like this. Level. Now colors. And look out that you mark this page here. And then

30
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:40,440
colors. Color to alpha. Choose white which is default and say okay. Now the color is

31
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:50,440
gone. You will see this if you switch off this page. Now you see it has no background anymore.

32
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:01,720
And this is the image we want to compare it with to the right. This one.

33
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:23,040
so we cut out which frequency this is about the frequency this is here

34
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:35,280
frequency 700 to 900 and something that is this image so we look in this image

35
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:48,840
for the same 690 to 960 that is the one we need so we cut this out make sure

36
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:59,840
that we are talking about this image. So click here and now draw a rectangle.

37
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:28,040
and with copy we copy this and now we can paste it as a new level paste there we are

38
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:39,520
Create a new level, but not level, I always use the wrong word, it's layers, not level.

39
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:56,400
To a new layer, switch off this image, switch on this, and drag this layer over this one.

40
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:08,800
So, first to the side.

41
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,680
Then we see that the orientation of this is towards the top and here it is towards the

42
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
right.

43
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,100
But it should be the same.

44
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:26,100
So we have to turn this one to the right to make it similar.

45
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Transformation, turn 90%.

46
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:39,100
Now it has the right, the correct orientation.

47
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,100
But it has a different size.

48
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,100
We have to adjust the size too.

49
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,100
And for this we have to measure the size.

50
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,100
Use the measure tool.

51
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,100
Click here on one end.

52
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,100
Draw down.

53
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:14,100
And at the bottom you can read the size 163.

54
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:35,580
We put 163 into the calculator, by, and then you measure this thing, that is 295, it's

55
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:44,140
down here, by 295.

56
00:10:44,140 --> 00:11:03,020
55 percent or if you take the reverse value, 181 percent. So you go here, say

57
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:16,780
scale level change this to percent 181 percent scale it now it has the same

58
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:22,140
size now you can draw it over

59
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:41,260
And look that the middle point is exactly on the other midpoint, like this.

60
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:52,100
And now we find the fault as expected, because this, which I switch on and off, is the original

61
00:11:52,100 --> 00:12:13,100
original data, and this is the given data.

62
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:42,300
And the stunt or dark blood.

63
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:50,420
So we add another layer, now this goes by automatic, the new layer.

64
00:12:50,420 --> 00:13:06,740
Now we add a text field, find space where we could write some text, choose color, let's

65
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:23,740
Let's say blue, and write blue, the other one, who am I?

66
00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:07,380
Okay, that's this part.

67
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:21,060
Now we take care about the, this is the horizontal part, horizontal, you see it here, now we

68
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:31,300
take care about the vertical part. The vertical diagram is this, or from Huawei it's in red.

69
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:54,300
So we go back to the worldwide, this one, make a copy of it, that is here, yeah, copy,

70
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:12,940
Switch this off, take the copy, draw this to the, here towards this, now we have to

71
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:33,380
turn it back. This one. Level. Transformation. Back. And now we can put it on top. If you

72
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,380
We want to be very precise, to size it up.

73
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,380
There we are.

74
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,380
So, and again, we need a text field.

75
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:15,020
For this, we could just copy this one, same as here, copy and move it down here and change

76
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:23,060
the text.

77
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:45,060
Mark the text icon, and this is red, red diagram, black, stand on top, stand on four, vertical.

78
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:56,260
Let's change it to vertical and blue, keep that blue, and here we change, add the text

79
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:24,020
Torisonto, Torisonto, also in German, no, yeah, now, switch this on again, if you want

80
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:44,020
to do it very nice then we should delete most of the red things so we go to this

81
00:17:44,020 --> 00:18:08,420
level take the rubber and delete the red line because this is confusing here in this diagram.

82
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:15,460
If you delete some of these dots, it doesn't matter, and if you delete it too much, like

83
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:32,460
here in this case, you can undo it with CTRL Z, or you can size it up to make it easier.

84
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:09,460
th

85
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:57,460
And here the same but the blue line must go, so mark this level and delete the blue line.

86
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,460
If you...

87
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:17,460
Yeah, that's good.

88
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:24,740
Okay.

89
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:48,360
That's all I wanted.

90
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:56,360
So now, the same with other pages.

91
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:24,360
Here we have the page for frequency, same frequency, we don't need the same again, we

92
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,360
I can add a white page at the end.

93
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:55,560
so this page first must be turned back

94
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:18,320
We have to find this, this is this page, and turn it against clockwise, counter-clockwise,

95
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,600
drag it towards this.

96
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,560
Yeah, and again

97
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,120
drag it here.

98
00:23:43,120 --> 00:24:07,120
Take out the other lever, this one, and that is the Y.

99
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:28,400
So, we drag it to the center, there we are.

100
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
already fits.

101
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:27,600
So, the third page is also good.

102
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Next page is here, we have to drag this one until it fits.

103
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:16,600
That is 1800.

104
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:45,600
So, if we write the frequency here, to name this, that is AD for antenna diagram, 690

105
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,080
9p to 960

106
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
It's the same

107
00:27:45,600 --> 00:28:04,440
No, I made a mistake.

108
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,400
The value for the frequency is this one, the smaller line above.

109
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:18,080
so that is 700, 800, 900

110
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,920
and here the same

111
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,360
and here the same

112
00:28:40,400 --> 00:29:08,400
And now we have 1800 in 10 diagram, 1821, 2636.

113
00:29:38,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Next level, we have to move again.

114
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:13,400
and the same frequency.

115
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:45,400
I took the wrong key. It's not AG, it's AD.

116
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
AD.

117
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
AD.

118
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:13,400
th

119
00:31:36,400 --> 00:32:01,400
So, and the last one... no, that is the last one.

120
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:19,840
Good.

121
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:38,840
So now we need to compare it with the right frequency, because here we compare 600 to

122
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:47,760
900 megahertz with 3600.

123
00:32:47,760 --> 00:33:07,560
So we have to switch off this, like this, and add the correct level from the diagram

124
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:35,160
that was here, that was this one, this one, so we go to this level,

125
00:33:37,560 --> 00:34:07,040
Make a rectangle around that, copy, insert, add to new layer, switch this off and move

126
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:34,800
this layer towards this diagram and we copy this for horizontal and for vertical.

127
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Vertical is already in the, we go back again because first we have to resize it, it was

128
00:34:54,040 --> 00:35:14,440
181% scale, the layer, 181% scale, and now we copy it, and can drag the copy here.

129
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:32,040
It does not fit really. It's smaller, huh?

130
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,040
So we have to do the resize again.

131
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:23,960
Yeah, we have to do the measurement again.

132
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:45,160
to get the right size. So, from one end to the other. Drag and drop this. It's 284.

133
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:31,280
one hundred and five percent

134
00:37:45,160 --> 00:38:09,660
this one must be resized. Big bigger. A bit bigger. Scale 105%. Scale. And now it fits.

135
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:19,660
So, we make a copy and drag this copy to the Vertigo Diabra.

136
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:34,660
And we write something here.

137
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:54,660
Where have I got to go for 269T and the other one?

138
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:23,660
And of course, now I write vertical for 900.

139
00:39:34,660 --> 00:40:03,760
Six and a half, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

140
00:40:33,760 --> 00:41:01,160
So when all is in place, in this case we can

141
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:24,660
draw the size of the page, which fits all, mark all,

142
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:29,060
Drag this to this page.

143
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:53,220
And now...

144
00:41:53,220 --> 00:42:21,140
image by selection. So now we have a nice page here, and we can

145
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:51,060
shoes, what do we like, what is this, who am I?

146
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:57,140
Vertical 690

147
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,140
Boai horizontal

148
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,140
Boai vertical

149
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,140
Should be the same, no?

150
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,140
Let's take a look.

151
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,140
Ah, here's the size problem.

152
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,140
The 5% is somehow wrong.

153
00:43:51,140 --> 00:44:20,140
OK, this one is too small, so we just choose this and size it up, so that's it.

154
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:24,140
Size it up, scale, 105 percent.

155
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,140
Now it fits.

156
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:36,140
So, we have the 960.

157
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:45,140
And this is also for about the 900.

158
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:48,300
okay that's it now we save this under the name

159
00:46:50,140 --> 00:47:04,820
Now, take this name and that's what I need to be done.

160
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,620
Thank you.
