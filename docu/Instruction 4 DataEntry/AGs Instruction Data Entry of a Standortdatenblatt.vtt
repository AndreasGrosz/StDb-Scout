00:00.000 --> 00:22.380
Hello, I show you how to do the data entry from the data sheet, the given Standort Datenblatt.

00:22.380 --> 00:33.820
You look for this page first for the page called Zusatzplatt 2.

00:33.820 --> 00:37.340
It's also A2.

00:37.340 --> 00:41.780
This is where you start.

00:41.780 --> 00:50.340
And you open a template for the calculation.

00:50.340 --> 00:58.340
And there you find the term Zusatzblatt 2, again here.

00:58.340 --> 01:05.700
So now you enter the data, which is here in red.

01:05.700 --> 01:19.660
you look up above, you start with the date of the sheet, which you cannot find here on

01:19.660 --> 01:33.740
this page. So you have to start on the first page. I go back to the first page. This is

01:33.740 --> 01:47.860
the first page here. And at the bottom you find the date. And you put it here.

01:47.860 --> 02:06.260
And the revision number is 1.22 and the address of the antenna, which you find usually on

02:06.260 --> 02:11.260
page three at the top, yes, the address.

02:11.260 --> 02:40.780
And yeah, that's not right, you don't have to change this, it's the newest revision of

02:40.780 --> 03:05.980
this template. So next data in red is Höhenquote. This was on page A2. Here we are. Höhenquote.

03:10.780 --> 03:36.380
1099, 1099 dot, nothing more here.

03:36.380 --> 03:48.140
Now the frequency. Frequency is here. At least you check that you enter the right values.

03:48.140 --> 04:11.040
it's has to be changed 1800 so these depend on that so but you can overwrite

04:11.040 --> 04:24.600
this so now there are only six not more you sometimes number seven is on the

04:24.600 --> 04:32.720
next page or down next table not in this case in this case you only have six

04:32.720 --> 04:43.400
columns and in the template you have much more. I had 18 columns so you just

04:43.400 --> 04:50.400
delete the unneeded columns.

05:02.400 --> 05:06.400
Delete the columns.

05:06.400 --> 05:21.720
So that was the frequency. Now the company who creates it. Sometimes you have a different

05:21.720 --> 05:33.040
name in different columns. Not in this case. It's all the same. Swisscom. Next line is

05:33.040 --> 05:51.240
the antenna type, so you just put the antenna type into your clipboard and enter it here.

05:51.240 --> 05:57.520
By automatic, this is copied to the other columns, but you have to check because sometimes

05:57.520 --> 06:01.040
Sometimes it is different.

06:01.040 --> 06:08.000
The difference at the end of the name is of no importance.

06:08.000 --> 06:19.460
Best is even to delete it, because this end is the same.

06:19.460 --> 06:23.680
It indicates just the frequency.

06:23.680 --> 06:41.320
You see it here 7, 8, 900, 700 to 900 is here and here it is 18, 21, 26, 36 is this frequency.

06:41.320 --> 07:05.440
So just delete the rest, and this is not an O, it is a zero, and that is not an L, it

07:05.440 --> 07:21.280
is the one, so that would be the correct type. Next, adaptiver Betrieb is no no no no, always,

07:21.280 --> 07:34.880
and subarrays it's always zero or none. Now we have Höhe der Antenne that is

07:34.880 --> 07:59.080
different. So you take this for the first. And this for the second. And this again.

07:59.080 --> 08:20.440
And now the power, Sendeleistung, just add this.

08:20.440 --> 08:49.600
And the values for the direction azimuth is 60.

08:49.600 --> 09:00.800
And this repeats, usually.

09:00.800 --> 09:30.040
So horizontal 0, 9, 6, 0, 9, 6, and the other one is minus 2.

09:30.040 --> 09:56.200
minus 2, minus 2, minus, minus 12, minus 7, minus 12, minus 12, and that is a calculated

09:56.200 --> 10:07.480
line we keep it as it is calculated and that's all on this sheet so you scroll

10:07.480 --> 10:23.800
down to the next one and here you scroll down to number of Omen number one that

10:23.800 --> 10:38.040
is this the number in situation plan is 1 so perhaps 0 1 and now we have to save

10:38.040 --> 10:48.200
the file the table to the name we just found

10:48.200 --> 10:52.760
Omen 01

11:05.600 --> 11:17.400
Adresse und Beschreibung. Beschreibung der Adresse. Mast, Fuß. That's what you put here.

11:18.200 --> 11:38.600
And here Nutzung, this field is here. Nutzung after the double dot. Durch Zugang.

11:48.200 --> 12:16.400
This is the next value we need, that's Höhe über Boden, Höhe über Boden, 1.5, 1.5.

12:16.400 --> 12:32.120
and here we have deleted one entry field that is the next one here over here in

12:32.120 --> 12:46.640
0, also 150.

12:46.640 --> 12:57.480
This was red before, but we deleted it when we deleted the columns, but it doesn't care

12:57.480 --> 13:05.280
whether it's red or not it's just for your orientation while enter the data so

13:05.280 --> 13:13.320
now the next values from the table and the top of this table repeats the

13:13.320 --> 13:21.960
format table so you don't have to put this in again but we continue with

13:21.960 --> 13:33.440
horizontal distance or your central distance it's zero zero keep this

13:35.480 --> 13:45.200
whoo on the sheets vision antenna and oka who notice sheet here you put these

13:45.200 --> 14:13.560
is 8.20, 11, 8.20, 8.20, 11, and 8.20.

14:13.560 --> 14:18.560
So, in fact, this is our entry fields.

14:22.520 --> 14:26.240
Should not be gray and should be red.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.240
That is a mistake in the template.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.820
I have to correct this for the next revision.

14:34.160 --> 14:37.120
But this is the line which is calculated

14:37.120 --> 14:39.920
and it is correctly calculated.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.560
I have the same values.

14:41.560 --> 14:44.560
And now the next.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.560
Azimuth.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.560
Azimuth.

14:57.560 --> 15:20.400
We have to write in this, that is 180.

15:20.400 --> 15:25.400
All fields, copy this across the line.

15:28.920 --> 15:29.960
Elevation.

15:32.760 --> 15:37.400
This is taken from above, so don't change anything there.

15:38.460 --> 15:39.380
It's gray.

15:44.800 --> 15:48.660
Critical horizontal senderichtung.

15:48.660 --> 16:15.660
Critical horizontal senderichtung, 60, that's correct, vertical, star 2, plus 7, minus 7,

16:15.660 --> 16:30.020
Minus 12, 2, and minus 17.

16:30.020 --> 16:41.620
The next two you just check, usually it is correct, yes, and here too, it's the same,

16:41.620 --> 16:50.140
dis-calculated values. So next red fields to be entered are these Richtungsabschwächung,

16:50.140 --> 17:12.340
25.9, 11.3, 5.3, 25, 12.4, 2, 4.

17:20.140 --> 17:47.460
Oops.

17:47.460 --> 17:52.460
Next two are calculated.

17:52.460 --> 18:03.420
Next red one is not given here in this case, but we will see it in the next example.

18:03.420 --> 18:13.880
So keep this and look for the final value and they calculated 13.25 and we calculated

18:13.880 --> 18:38.400
13.15. I have an idea how this comes. There is somewhere a rounding here.

18:38.400 --> 18:50.400
I don't care about the difference.

18:50.400 --> 18:57.280
It's about 1% difference, so if it is 1% difference, then don't care about this.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.680
That's correct.

18:59.680 --> 19:04.320
We did it correctly.

19:04.320 --> 19:17.160
So you save this again, save, and scroll down to the next page.

19:17.160 --> 19:21.140
Next page is Omen number 2.

19:21.140 --> 19:38.380
So for this, we save this under a new name, 02.

19:38.380 --> 19:41.060
And the top is the same.

19:41.060 --> 19:48.300
We start here with 02.

19:48.300 --> 20:13.500
And now the address of this point, enter the address, and the purpose of it, wunnen.

20:13.500 --> 20:41.500
And the other value, value, value, value is nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine,

20:41.500 --> 20:44.860
The value is 9.2.

20:53.140 --> 20:56.740
Go down, this is repeated.

20:56.740 --> 21:01.620
And now we are, we look for horizontal

21:01.620 --> 21:04.100
upstand, horizontal upstand.

21:05.900 --> 21:10.740
45.3 through the whole row.

21:11.500 --> 21:30.620
okay 5.3 next to is calculated no this is not calculated has to be entered point

21:30.620 --> 21:51.080
point five, three three, point five, point five, three three, point five, yes and this

21:51.080 --> 22:02.920
This should be calculated identical, just check.

22:02.920 --> 22:30.040
And the next row, as you would, 244, 244 across the row.

22:30.040 --> 22:52.480
it's the same critical horizontal critical horizontal critical horizontal 60 it's the same

22:52.480 --> 23:20.940
and minus four minus yeah minus two plus four minus one minus two minus one minus one

23:22.480 --> 23:48.200
Here is the difference, but it's not red, so you don't enter it, but here.

23:48.200 --> 24:15.200
24.8, 4.9, 7.8, 26.5, 4.4, 10.2

24:18.200 --> 24:39.280
Next line, 0.1, 0.4, 0, 0, 0.3, 0.

24:39.280 --> 24:49.880
is calculated and here you find Bauweise, Glass, Glass, zero. It's the only two you

24:49.880 --> 25:02.400
have to enter, the rest is identical. And to check whether you are right, you look

25:02.400 --> 25:16.200
Look at these values, this row, and that should be identical to this row.

25:16.200 --> 25:31.760
There is a small difference, but it's about 1%, so don't care, similar here, but perhaps

25:31.760 --> 25:40.720
you could find. The reason if you go up in the values which are different,

25:40.720 --> 25:53.320
perhaps you could mark this as different and go up and find what might be the

25:53.320 --> 25:58.320
Because of the difference, it's somewhere in these data.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.320
It's this.

26:02.320 --> 26:05.320
This value. Let's check.

26:23.320 --> 26:41.720
did not help much but okay yeah and here is also as a result big difference but

26:41.720 --> 26:49.920
it's just one percent so don't care about this otherwise you you look which

26:49.920 --> 27:01.560
column is much different this compare this with this where the difference is

27:01.560 --> 27:11.360
and then you find the values which are wrong which are these two columns and

27:11.360 --> 27:19.280
then you go back and look which what values might have been entered wrongly

27:19.280 --> 27:38.320
by you. Yeah, that's it. Now you'll save this again under the name 02 and now you continue

27:38.320 --> 27:55.240
up to the next one three and save under the new name three and continue as

27:55.240 --> 27:56.240
as before.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.760
Put in three here, zero, three.

28:14.360 --> 28:19.480
Brunnistraße, that is third floor.

28:19.480 --> 28:35.600
It's also wohnen here and the horizontal distance is different.

28:35.600 --> 29:05.320
Höhe über Boden, 10.33, 11.90, that's this, and so on, as shown before.

29:05.320 --> 29:15.320
Thank you for your patience, enjoy and you can help me a lot with this work.
